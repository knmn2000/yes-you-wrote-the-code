# Facing Allegations?

You are assigned the task of making a website. Strong animations and beautiful design. Extensive use of effects and css.

Now, you've written **"Web Developer"**, in bold and capital on your LinkedIn profile.

Deep down, you know. You never wrote good css or js. It was always **colorlib** and **themeforest** which came to your rescue while making the college fest website. Sometimes even **bootsnipp**. And the generic github repos you cloned and refactored.

Web Developer? **LMAO**
***

**Web Deb EC** :  Hey, I made this awesome website all by myself. I am a frontend wizard.

**Vasisth** : This is an old template I once used for a client üòù

**Good Old Vasisth Bhaiya üß°** 

***

You look back and think. You deleted all the comments and unwanted footer materials from all the html and css files. **What went wrong?**

The thing is people exist who can find through one small element inspection, where the code is copied from. So much for being a web developer. 

Well, here is a script to the rescue. To save you from all the insults of plagiarism and embarrasment. **Copying is fun**. 

Taking pride in other people's work is good karma.

### How to use it?

Simply copy paste `main.py` and `utils.py` in the source folder, and execute `main.py`. Let the wizard guide you towards the road of redemption.
